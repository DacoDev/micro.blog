			 <p>Most of my DevOps experience is in using GitLab, but I&rsquo;ve used GitHub Actions and Jenkins in the past. I also tried out Concourse for a few weeks but that didn&rsquo;t end too well&hellip; Very strong opinions there that didn&rsquo;t mesh with the flexibility that I needed and expected.</p>

			 <p>Using the LLM&rsquo;s help, I&rsquo;ve been able to up-skill quickly. Asking for a quick review of a function or reviewing my usage of a library in seconds helps troubleshoot the little things quickly, reducing the need to read pages and pages of docs and looking up examples.</p>

			 <p>Being that Python is so widely used, AI tools have tons of data on it and can be really helpful. I&rsquo;ve been using CodeGPT and Tabnine in my IDE (mainly JetBrains products, but VSCode for non-app level dev). I know there&rsquo;s a billion examples of using AI for development, but it is so incredibly useful.</p>

			 <p>Over the past year or so, I&rsquo;ve developed internal applications using React/TypeScript, ExpressAPI, and Next.JS, but really I want to get back to basics and start over with Python. I&rsquo;ve used it fairly extensively as a scripting language but after seeing some of the webapps made with Django in a short period of time, I want to check that out.</p>

			 <p>I wanted a platform like this so that I can post small tips-and-tricks that I create or come across in solving issue I run in to. If anything just for myself so I can catalog little things I&rsquo;ve done but can&rsquo;t really remember what I did to fix it the last time.</p>

			 <p>So I&rsquo;ve decided to jump in to software development. I&rsquo;m pursuing my degree in CS though I&rsquo;ve been in the industry for years and have been doing DevOps work for the past 4-5 years. There&rsquo;s a whole other world of software creation out there. I want to post here with interesting things I find, create, or fix.</p>
